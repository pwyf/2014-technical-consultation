Consultation on 2014 Aid Transparency Index
===========================================

We welcome feedback on the data quality tests run against IATI-XML data as part of the Aid Transparency Index.

This consultation runs until **21st February**. We will confirm the final tests that will be used in the 2014 Index shortly thereafter.

We are using Github Issues to record:
* the tests used in 2013;
* the initial ideas on improvements we are considering;
* any feedback from the public consultation process.

If you have any comments on the tests for each indicator, please add them under the relevant [issue](https://github.com/pwyf/index-data-quality-tests/issues).

Please note that we will retain all 39 indicators used in the 2013 Index. No new indicators will be added in 2014.
