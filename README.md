Consultation on 2014 Aid Transparency Index
===========================================
*Data quality tests*
------------------

You can find information on our consultation for the 2014 Index tests here. **The consultation runs until 21st February**, and we will confirm the final tests to be used shortly thereafter.

We are using Github Issues to record:
* the tests used in 2013
* our initial ideas on improvements we are considering
* any feedback from the public consultation process.

If you have any opinions about the tests to be used in the 2014 Index, please add your comments under the relevant [issues](https://github.com/pwyf/index-data-quality-tests/issues).

In particular, we're looking for:
* specific feedback on the tests we're using - how we could improve them, or add nuance
* test expressions that we could use to address your feedback - the more specific, the better.

Please note a couple of limitations of this consultation:
* we will not add any additional indicators in the 2014 Index
* all tests should be programmable

Manual sampling will be used in the 2014 Index to check the quality of inputs (whether they conform to the spirit of the IATI Standard). However, manual sampling will be kept to a minimum and needs to provide clear decision-making criteria for the user.
