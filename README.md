Consultation on 2014 Aid Transparency Index
===========================================

You can find information on our consultation for the 2014 Index data quality tests here. **The consultation runs until 21st February**, and we will confirm the final tests to be used shortly thereafter.

We are using Github Issues to record:
* the tests used in 2013
* our initial ideas on improvements we are considering
* any feedback from the public consultation process.

If you have any opinions about the tests to be used in the 2014 Index, please add your comments under the relevant [issues](https://github.com/pwyf/index-data-quality-tests/issues).

Please note a couple of limitations of this consultation:
* we will not add any additional indicators in the 2014 Index;
* all tests should be programmable.
